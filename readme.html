<h1>polySortV3</h1>
<br>
<p>My third attempt at creating a ideally working sorting system, using only the built-in `inventory` peripheral and wired modems.</p>
<br>
<p>In this iteration, there should be a host computer that manages both the sorting and indexing subroutines, 
sending out a rednet message containing the indexed itemTable for use by the client machines per their request.
These client machines recieve the signal, update their itemTables, then use those to supply `list` and `request` functionality to the end user.</p>

<p>If you're wondering why my readme is in HTML, it's because I <s>hate</s> find it easier than markdown. 
    I have no idea how to get gitHub to render it but I'll just pretend like it's working for now.</p>
